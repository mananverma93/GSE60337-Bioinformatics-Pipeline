# Analysis of Mouse Gene Expression Divergence (GSE60337) ðŸ§¬

This repository provides the reproducible bioinformatics workflow (built with **Snakemake**) used to analyze the **GSE60337** microarray dataset, which investigates gene expression differences between two common inbred mouse strains.

The primary goal is to identify **Differentially Expressed (DE) genes** that distinguish the **C57BL/6J** ("Black Six") and **CBA/CaJ** strains.

## Analysis Workflow: From Raw Data to Differential Expression

The pipeline processes the raw expression data through four distinct, reproducible stages:

### 1. Quality Control (QC)
* The raw expression matrix is initially filtered to ensure data integrity.
* **Action:** Gene probes with low overall expression are removed to reduce noise and increase statistical power. This ensures that only reliably detected genes proceed to normalization.

### 2. Normalization
* Data is adjusted across all samples to ensure that differences in expression values are due to biological variation, not technical artifacts.
* **Action:** The filtered data is normalized (e.g., using a method like RMA or quantile normalization, depending on your script) to make sample distributions comparable.

### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
* After normalization, the data is explored to verify batch-effect removal and identify major sources of variation.
* **Analysis:** Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is performed to visualize sample clustering and confirm separation based on the biological factor of interest (mouse strain).
* **Analysis:** A Heatmap of the top variable genes is generated to visualize global expression patterns.

### 4. Differential Expression (DE) Analysis
* The core statistical test to identify genes whose expression levels are significantly different between the two strains.
* **Comparison:** C57BL/6J vs. CBA/CaJ.
* **Method:** A two-sample **Student's t-test** is applied for every gene to calculate raw $\text{p-values}$ and $\text{log}_{2}\text{fold changes}$.
* **Correction:** $\text{P-values}$ are adjusted using the **FDR (False Discovery Rate)** method to control the family-wise error rate, resulting in the final adjusted $\text{p-values}$ for significance testing.
